# Module 4 Classification Coding Assignment

This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook for the "SVM and Decision Tree classification using sklearn python library". 
This notebook is designed to guide you through the process of building and evaluating classification models using machine learning techniques.

## Contents

- **Introduction**: An overview of the classification problem tackled in this module.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Steps for data cleaning and transformation to prepare it for model training.
- **Feature Selection**: Techniques used to select the most relevant features for improved model performance.
- **Model Building**: Implementation of various classification algorithms.
- **Model Evaluation**: Metrics and methods used to evaluate the performance of the classification models.

## Classification Algorithms

The notebook explores the following classification algorithms:

- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)

## Evaluation Metrics
